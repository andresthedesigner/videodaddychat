description: Phase 1 - Research and explore before implementation
---

# Research Phase

**Goal:** Gather context before writing any code.

## Instructions

1. **Read relevant files** - Understand existing patterns
2. **Search codebase** - Find related implementations
3. **Identify dependencies** - What needs to be imported/used
4. **Note edge cases** - Security, performance, error handling
5. **DO NOT write code yet** - Only research and document findings

## What to Research

- Existing patterns in the codebase (see `@AGENTS.md` for gold standards)
- Related files and their dependencies
- Edge cases and error scenarios
- Security implications
- Performance considerations
- Testing requirements

## Output Format

```markdown
## Research Summary

### Existing Patterns Found
- [Pattern/file reference]

### Dependencies Identified
- [Dependency/import needed]

### Edge Cases to Consider
- [Edge case]

### Security Considerations
- [Security note]

### Next Steps
- [What to plan next]
```

## Reference

See `@docs/workflows.md` for the complete four-phase coding cycle.
